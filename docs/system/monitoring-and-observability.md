## **üõ°Ô∏è 4\. Anomaly Detection and Escalation Protocols**

### **‚úÖ 4.1 Types of Anomalies**

* **Minor Anomalies:** Small inconsistencies auto-resolved without human intervention.  
* **Major Anomalies:** Errors requiring Planner or Executor intervention.  
* **Critical Anomalies:** Workflow halts or systemic failures requiring immediate escalation.

### **‚úÖ 4.2 Anomaly Escalation Workflow**

1. **Detection:** Overwatch identifies anomalies via real-time logs.  
2. **Categorization:** Anomalies are categorized (Minor, Major, Critical).  
3. **Resolution Attempt:** Minor anomalies are auto-resolved.  
4. **Escalation Path:**  
   * **Major:** Routed to Planner/Executor for correction.  
   * **Critical:** Immediate escalation to administrators.

### **‚úÖ 4.3 Escalation Logs**

* Detailed logs for each anomaly.  
* Timestamped records of anomaly detection, escalation, and resolution.  
* Root cause analysis documented for systemic improvement.

**Escalation Example Workflow:**

1. **Step 1:** Overwatch detects repeated validation failures.  
2. **Step 2:** Logs failure details and timestamps.  
3. **Step 3:** Escalates issue to administrative dashboard.  
4. **Step 4:** Administrator intervenes and resolves issue.

## **üîÑ 5\. Continuous Feedback Loops**

Overwatch creates an ongoing cycle of monitoring, detection, and feedback to ensure system-wide improvement.

### **‚úÖ 5.1 Planner Feedback Loop**

* Detect planning inefficiencies and bottlenecks.  
* Suggest task redesign for better performance.

### **‚úÖ 5.2 Executor Feedback Loop**

* Identify task execution errors.  
* Recommend optimization techniques for task efficiency.

### **‚úÖ 5.3 Evaluator Feedback Loop**

* Highlight recurring validation issues.  
* Recommend improvements to validation benchmarks.

**Feedback Workflow Example:**

1. Overwatch detects resource overconsumption during task execution.  
2. Feedback sent to Planner for better resource allocation.  
3. Executor adjusts workflows based on the updated resource plan.
