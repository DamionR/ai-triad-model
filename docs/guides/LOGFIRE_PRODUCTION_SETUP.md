## Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install logfire>=4.0.0 prisma==0.13.1 pydantic-ai>=0.0.12

# Set environment variables
export LOGFIRE_TOKEN="pylf_v1_us_RBzlVBKMK2kWbCh8nYwT6qzq8cbpjqfSczvLZ5zq8wQq"
export DATABASE_URL="file:./data/triad_production.db"
export TRIAD_ENV="production"
```

### Logfire Account Configuration
1. Create a Logfire project named "triadmodel"
2. Generate write token: `pylf_v1_us_RBzlVBKMK2kWbCh8nYwT6qzq8cbpjqfSczvLZ5zq8wQq`
3. Generate read token: `pylf_v1_us_RCN2RNnwh1RZBS2tk94TLcxDD29ZF9cnNnqZZrWQv6QK`

## Dashboard Configuration

### 1. Constitutional Agents Dashboard

Create a dashboard to monitor the four constitutional agents:

```sql
-- Agent Activity Overview
SELECT 
    agent,
    activity,
    COUNT(*) as activity_count,
    AVG(duration) as avg_duration_ms
FROM logs 
WHERE system = 'triad-model' 
    AND component = 'agents'
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY agent, activity
ORDER BY activity_count DESC;

-- Constitutional Authority Distribution
SELECT 
    constitutional_authority,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    MAX(timestamp) as last_activity
FROM logs 
WHERE system = 'triad-model'
    AND constitutional_authority IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY constitutional_authority;
```

**Dashboard Widgets:**
- **Time Series Chart**: Agent activity over time
- **Bar Chart**: Tasks by constitutional authority
- **Table**: Recent agent activities with constitutional context
- **Pie Chart**: Activity distribution by agent type

### 2. Parliamentary Session Dashboard

Monitor parliamentary proceedings and democratic processes:

```sql
-- Active Parliamentary Sessions
SELECT 
    session_type,
    constitutional_authority,
    COUNT(*) as session_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ended_at - started_at))) as avg_duration_seconds
FROM logs 
WHERE component = 'parliamentary'
    AND parliamentary_event IS NOT NULL
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY session_type, constitutional_authority;

-- Constitutional Events Timeline
SELECT 
    timestamp,
    constitutional_event,
    constitutional_authority,
    details
FROM logs 
WHERE component = 'constitutional'
    AND priority = 'high'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Dashboard Widgets:**
- **Timeline**: Constitutional events chronology
- **Gauge**: Active parliamentary sessions
- **Table**: Recent parliamentary actions
- **Heat Map**: Constitutional authority activity patterns

### 3. System Health Dashboard

Monitor overall system performance and constitutional compliance:

```sql
-- System Metrics Overview
SELECT 
    metric_name,
    metric_value,
    metric_unit,
    timestamp
FROM logs 
WHERE triad_component = 'metrics'
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Constitutional Compliance Rate
SELECT 
    constitutional_compliant,
    COUNT(*) as review_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM logs 
WHERE component = 'constitutional'
    AND constitutional_compliant IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY constitutional_compliant;
```

**Dashboard Widgets:**
- **Number Display**: Constitutional compliance rate
- **Line Chart**: System performance metrics
- **Status Indicator**: Database connection health
- **Table**: Recent constitutional reviews

## Alert Setup

### 1. Constitutional Violation Alerts

Create alerts for constitutional compliance issues:

```yaml
# Constitutional Violation Alert
name: "Constitutional Violation Detected"
condition: |
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM logs 
  WHERE component = 'constitutional' 
    AND constitutional_compliant = false
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
threshold: 1
severity: "critical"
notification:
  webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK"
  message: "üö® Constitutional violation detected in Triad Model system"
```

### 2. Agent Performance Alerts

Monitor agent responsiveness and task completion:

```yaml
# Agent Task Failure Alert
name: "Agent Task Failures"
condition: |
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM logs 
  WHERE component = 'agents' 
    AND level = 'error'
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
threshold: 3
severity: "warning"
notification:
  webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK"
  message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple agent task failures detected"
```

### 3. Parliamentary Session Alerts

Alert on parliamentary process anomalies:

```yaml
# Long Running Parliamentary Session
name: "Parliamentary Session Timeout"
condition: |
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM logs 
  WHERE component = 'parliamentary' 
    AND session_type IS NOT NULL
    AND timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 minutes'
    AND ended_at IS NULL
threshold: 1
severity: "warning"
notification:
  webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK"
  message: "‚è∞ Parliamentary session running longer than expected"
```

## Telemetry Configuration

### Auto-Instrumentation Setup

The system automatically instruments key components:

```python
# Already configured in triad/core/logfire_config.py
def _setup_auto_instrumentation(self):
    """Set up auto-instrumentation for various integrations."""
    try:
        # FastAPI endpoints and middleware
        logfire.instrument_fastapi()
        
        # HTTP client requests
        logfire.instrument_httpx()
        logfire.instrument_requests()
        
        # Database operations
        logfire.instrument_sqlite3()
        logfire.instrument_sqlalchemy()
        
        # Pydantic AI agent interactions
        logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
        
        # System resource monitoring
        logfire.instrument_system_metrics()
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Some auto-instrumentation failed: {e}")
```

### Custom Span Configuration

For parliamentary sessions and constitutional events:

```python
# Example usage in your agents
from triad.core.logfire_config import get_logfire_config

logger = get_logfire_config()

# Parliamentary session tracking
with logger.parliamentary_session_span("question_period", ["planner", "executor"]) as span:
    # Parliamentary proceedings here
    span.set_attribute("session.outcome", "motion_passed")

# Agent task execution
async with logger.agent_task_span("planner", "policy_analysis", task_data) as span:
    # Agent work here
    span.set_attribute("task.constitutional_basis", "legislative")
```

## Agent Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Task Completion Rate**
   - Success/failure ratio by agent
   - Average task duration
   - Queue depth and backlog

2. **Constitutional Compliance**
   - Compliance review pass rate
   - Constitutional violation frequency
   - Authority escalation patterns

3. **Parliamentary Efficiency**
   - Session duration patterns
   - Motion pass/fail rates
   - Question period effectiveness

### Performance Queries

```sql
-- Agent Task Performance
SELECT 
    agent,
    COUNT(*) as total_tasks,
    SUM(CASE WHEN level = 'error' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed_tasks,
    ROUND(AVG(duration_ms), 2) as avg_duration_ms
FROM spans 
WHERE span_name LIKE 'agent-task-%'
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY agent
ORDER BY total_tasks DESC;

-- Constitutional Authority Workload
SELECT 
    constitutional_authority,
    COUNT(*) as events,
    MAX(timestamp) as last_activity
FROM logs 
WHERE constitutional_authority IS NOT NULL
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY constitutional_authority;
```

## Constitutional Oversight Dashboards

### Compliance Monitoring

Create specialized views for constitutional oversight:

```sql
-- Constitutional Review Summary
SELECT 
    review_type,
    target_type,
    constitutional_compliant,
    COUNT(*) as review_count,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT reviewing_agent, ', ') as reviewing_agents
FROM logs 
WHERE component = 'constitutional'
    AND review_type IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY review_type, target_type, constitutional_compliant
ORDER BY review_count DESC;

-- Violation Trends
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
    COUNT(*) as violation_count
FROM logs 
WHERE constitutional_compliant = false
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

### Authority Separation Tracking

Monitor separation of powers:

```sql
-- Cross-Authority Interactions
SELECT 
    source_authority,
    target_authority,
    interaction_type,
    COUNT(*) as interaction_count
FROM logs 
WHERE source_authority != target_authority
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY source_authority, target_authority, interaction_type;
```

## Parliamentary Session Tracking

### Session Analytics

```sql
-- Parliamentary Session Effectiveness
SELECT 
    session_type,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (session_end - session_start))) as avg_duration_seconds,
    COUNT(*) as total_sessions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN session_outcome = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful_sessions
FROM parliamentary_sessions 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY session_type;

-- Motion Success Rate
SELECT 
    motion_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_motions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN vote_result = 'passed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as passed_motions,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN vote_result = 'passed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as pass_rate
FROM parliamentary_motions 
GROUP BY motion_type;
```

## Database Monitoring with Prisma

### Prisma Operation Tracking

The system automatically tracks database operations:

```python
# Database operation spans are automatically created
async def create_agent(self, name: str, constitutional_authority: str):
    # This operation is automatically instrumented
    agent = await self.client.agent.create(
        data={
            "name": name,
            "constitutionalAuthority": constitutional_authority
        }
    )
    
    # Custom logging with constitutional context
    self.logger.info(
        "Agent created",
        agent_name=name,
        constitutional_authority=constitutional_authority,
        parliamentary_accountability=True
    )
```

### Database Health Monitoring

```sql
-- Database Operation Performance
SELECT 
    operation_type,
    table_name,
    COUNT(*) as operation_count,
    AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms,
    MAX(duration_ms) as max_duration_ms
FROM database_operations 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY operation_type, table_name
ORDER BY avg_duration_ms DESC;

-- Connection Pool Health
SELECT 
    timestamp,
    active_connections,
    idle_connections,
    max_connections
FROM connection_pool_metrics 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

    args: 'main.py',
    env: {
      TRIAD_ENV: 'production',
      LOGFIRE_TOKEN: 'pylf_v1_us_RBzlVBKMK2kWbCh8nYwT6qzq8cbpjqfSczvLZ5zq8wQq'
    }
  }]
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Logfire Connection Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check token validity
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer pylf_v1_us_RBzlVBKMK2kWbCh8nYwT6qzq8cbpjqfSczvLZ5zq8wQq" \
        https://api.logfire.dev/health
   
   # Verify fallback logging
   python -c "from triad.core.logfire_config import initialize_logfire; print(initialize_logfire())"
   ```

2. **Missing Spans or Traces**
   ```python
   # Enable debug logging
   import logging
   logging.getLogger('logfire').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   ```

3. **Database Instrumentation Issues**
   ```python
   # Manually instrument if auto-instrumentation fails
   import logfire
   logfire.instrument_sqlite3()
   ```

### Health Check Endpoints

```python
# Add to your FastAPI app
@app.get("/health/logfire")
async def logfire_health():
    from triad.core.logfire_config import get_logfire_config
    config = get_logfire_config()
    return {
        "configured": config.configured,
        "fallback_mode": config.fallback_mode,
        "instrumentation": "enabled"
    }
```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Sampling Configuration**
   ```python
   # Reduce trace volume in high-traffic scenarios
   logfire.configure(
       sampling_rate=0.1  # Sample 10% of traces
   )
   ```

2. **Batch Export**
   ```python
   # Configure batch export for better performance
   logfire.configure(
       batch_export=True,
       max_batch_size=512
   )
   ```
